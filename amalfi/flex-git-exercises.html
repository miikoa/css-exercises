  <h1> Vacationing In Italy</h1>
  <p> It Italy has always been on your bucket list, well it is time to make it happen.  
    I know what you are thinking.  It is far. It is expensive, on and on.  Some of your points
    are in fact valid but if Covid has taught us anything and that is that is meant to be lived.  
    Life is meant to be experienced and Italy is an experience that everyone must enjoy firsthand.

    <h2>Positano</h2>
    <p>Positano is absolutely beautiful. I must return one day soon. The beautiful homes pressed into the rocky cliffs. The colorful homes that go back to the begining of time and the smells of lemons everywhere. Let's not talk about the creamy lemon sorbet that I devoured. </p>

  <h2> Evening Strolls along the Amalfi Coast</h2>
  <p> On this particular evening, we decided to talk a little evening stroll to the next town over, Manori.  
    The roads are narrow but very walkable.  As we strolled, we could not take our eyes off of the sea 
    and magical glow of the moon. The lovely street lamps that lined our little town, Minori also make up 
    one of the wonderful memories of that vacation.</p>

  <h2> Exploring along the Coast of Capri</h2>
  <p> After taking the boat to Capri, we decided to hire a tour guide. We debated but 
    in the end it was a great choice.  The main reason being that it allowed us to skip 
    the crazy lines that were every where.  The guide mentioned things here and there but 
    one thing that stood out was that this picture was taken not far from where Lenin made a major decision. </p>
